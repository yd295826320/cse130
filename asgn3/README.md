Use this README document to store notes about design, testing, and
questions you have while developing your assignment.

For the queue is really simple and stright forward. I was using the shift method to do the pop and push the element to the tail
For testing, I made some test myself and using the test script.

For the rwlock is the hard part of this assignment. The first difficult thing is almost all the TAs or tuters aren't hundred percent sure how this lock should work.
Secondly, the example on the assignment pdf is really hard to understand. Plus there is only one test for it at the beginning. 
All of the reasons made this assignment really confusing and hard to understand. 

The majority of time of my work on this assignment is asking what is rwlock's functionalitly and how to test it out.
I went to a lot of section for this, harish and mitchell are really helpful. 
I got a lof of ideas from mitchell's pseduocde.
The structer is really complicated to explain and I left comments inside the script to explain.
